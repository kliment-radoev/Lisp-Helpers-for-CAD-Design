The repository contains multiple AutoLISP files to aid and advance architectural design. All of the files should be uploaded with APPLOAD (application load) command in AutoCAD.
They have been constantly upgrading and improving as a whole system from version AutoCAD 14. Each file wears a name describing its function.
In order to use the files Layers.dwg should be imported.
This system of shortcuts, command sets, and functions was designed to bring extreme speed and improvement of drawing. The design time can be reduced by up to 60%

ChangeObjectsLayer.lsp -
In architectural design in the past professionals have been using sets of fineliners to make their drawings. They have been able to draw lines with thicknesses from 0.2 mm to 1 mm.
However, in the CAD design, we need to assign these thicknesses to different colors and layers. These layers were initially designed within Layers.dwg. Their thicknesses were set up in the plotting file Thicknesses.ctb .
So, if the users want to move an object to a layer of thickness 0.2 mm for example they just press "2" - "space". If the layer is of thickness 0.3 mm - "3" - "space" and so on.
The commands work also with pick first method.
The layers are designed with different colors in order to be easily distinguishable.

ChangeObjectsLineType.lsp -
This file offers commands to change the line type of an object to HIDDEN with 3 different scales and DASHDOT with 3 different scales as well.

1` - key for small-scale HIDDEN
21 - key for average-scale HIDDEN
32 - key for large-scale HIDDEN

11` - key for small-scale DASHDOT
221 - key for average-scale DASHDOT
332 - key for large-scale DASHDOT

`` - key for continuous line belonging to the containing layer

You may notice that the keys are in close proximity, which is designed to achieve high drawing speed.
